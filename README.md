# DonovanVsDevin

As it stands this is a simple repo with two projects:

1. The titular project, a Razor pages .NET Core website.
2. Azure Functions to encapsulate an API for the PER lookup (thanks ESPN).

## TODOs

1. Write the damn readme!
2. Add historical matchups between Booker and Mitchell.
3. Parse daily PER values into a database and add graphs!
4. Mayyyyyyyyyyyyyybe allow specification of players.
5. PERhaps look at other stats.
6. Turn these damn TODOs into Issues.
7. Maybe use Vue for this? I don't know, I love it so why not. Am I helping?
