![Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD](https://github.com/itsxallwater/DonovanVsDevin/workflows/Azure%20Static%20Web%20Apps%20CI/CD/badge.svg)

## Description

As it stands this is a simple repo with two projects:

1. `api`, an Azure Functions project to create an API for the PER lookup (thanks ESPN).
2. `src`, a Vue.js static site.

The site was built using:

1. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
3. [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
4. [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
