# Donovan vs Devin

As it stands this is a simple repo with two projects:

1. The titular project, a Vue.js static site.
2. Azure Functions to encapsulate an API for the PER lookup (thanks ESPN).

## Todos

- [ ] Update the damn readme!
- [ ] Move PER values to a DB and update API call.
- [ ] Add historical matchups between Booker and Mitchell.
- [ ] Add graphs!
- [ ] Mayyyyyyyyyyyyyybe allow specification of players.
- [ ] PERhaps look at other stats.
- [ ] Turn these damn TODOs into Issues.
- [ ] Ricky Rubio played with Donovan and now he's playing with Devin. Maybe he is interesting to add into the mix?!?
- [ ] Add in season by season comps.
